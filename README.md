Auryn is a simple React-Native sample application running on You.i Engine One. Its primary purpose is to show a movie and TV experience using You.i's After Effects designer workflow integrated with React Native using
React-Navigation and React-Redux.

  - **Technology stack**: Auryn requires the You.i Engine One SDK and is built using TypeScript with React Nativeâ€™s JSX syntax and cross-platform C++.
  - **Platforms**: Auryn can be built to run on iOS, Android, tvOS, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Tizen, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Development can be done on macOS, Windows, or Linux.

## Installation

**Please note that you will need access to the You.i Engine One SDK in order to build and run this application.**

### Install You.i Engine One SDK
There are a few dependencies that needs to be pre-installed before building the app, depending on your platform. Please follow the installation instructions at [our Developer Portal](https://developer.youi.tv/latest/Content/InstallationCommon/H1IntroToInstallSection.htm) before continuing.

### 3rd party API keys
Auryn uses free data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/). You will need to provide your own API key for the app to run. API keys can be requested [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Once you acquire the API key, add it to the existing `secrets.ts` file in the root of the Auryn project. You may want to run [`git update-index --skip-worktree src/secrets.ts`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39776107/2736686) to stop tracking changes to this file.

## Usage

To get started, simply clone the repository and install all dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/YOU-i-Labs/Auryn
cd Auryn
yarn install
```

Building the app is done via the You.i CLI. You can find the full documentations for this on our developer portal but we'll walk through the basics here.

`youi-tv generate -p <Platform>` will create the relevant project based on the selected platform (Xcode,
Android Studio, Visual Studio, etc.) in the corresponding `build` folder.

Supported platforms are: `osx, android, ios, tvos, tizen-nacl, uwp,
ps4, linux`

For example, to build for macOS:
```shell
youi-tv generate -p osx [-c Debug|Release]
youi-tv build -p osx [-c Debug|Release]
```
For additional information on the build scripts please refer to [this
page.](https://developer.youi.tv/latest/Content/RN_BuildingAppsTopics/H2RNBuildProc.htm)

Next, open a new terminal window, navigate back to the Auryn root directory and start the Metro bundler server. The Metro bundler will need its own process to run the server:
```shell
cd <Path to Auryn root directory>/
yarn start
```

Finally, in your original terminal window, start the app:
```shell
youi-tv run -p <Platform> [-c Debug|Release]
```

## Debugging

You.i Engine apps support remote debugging just like a regular React Native app. To turn on debugging, press or touch any corner of the app 3 times in a row. The You.i Engine debug menu will open where you can turn on "Remote JS debugging".

*Note*: Debugging incurs a performance hit and is not recommended when testing on low end devices.

## FAQ

### Auryn launches, but won't get past the splash screen
Auryn requires an API key from TMDB. Without it, no data will load and the splash screen will not navigate to the main lander.

### Auryn is running slow on most devices
You.i Engine apps provide a verbose amount of information in debug mode which is useful for development, but taxing on most devices. You will see significant performance improvements in release mode. To build in release pass the `-c Release` flag to the build scripts, or choose the proper configuration in your IDE.
